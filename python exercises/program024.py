# Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it,
# you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in
# document function for every built-in functions.

# Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents,
# such as abs(), int(), raw_input()

# And add document for your own function

# Hints:
# The built-in document method is __doc__


def absolute(number):
        # it will return absolute Number

    return abs(number)

print absolute(int(raw_input('Enter Number :')))


print abs.__doc__
print int.__doc__
print raw_input.__doc__
