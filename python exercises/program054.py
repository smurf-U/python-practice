# Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has
# an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a
# area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area
# is 0 by default.

# Hints:
# To override a method in super class, we can define a method with the
# same name in the super class.


class Shape(object):

    def area(self):
        return 0

        print 'calling init method'
        self.length = length

    def area(self):

def main():
    squareObj = Square(int(raw_input('Enter Length : ')))
    # squareObj = Square(int('5'))
    print 'Area of Square is : ', squareObj.area()
