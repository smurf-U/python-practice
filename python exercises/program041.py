# Define a function which can generate and print a tuple where
# the value are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).

# Hints:
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.
# Use list.append() to add values into a list.
# Use tuple() to get a tuple from a list.

    for value in range(1, 21):
        numbers.append(str(value ** 2))
    print tuple(numbers)
