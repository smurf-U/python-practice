# program066:
# The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:

# f(n)=0 if n=0
# f(n)=1 if n=1
# f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1

# Please write a program to compute the value of f(n)
# with a given n input by console.

# Example:
# If the following n is given as input to the program:
# 7
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# 13

# In case of input data being supplied to the question,
# it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Hints:
# We can define recursive function in Python.
