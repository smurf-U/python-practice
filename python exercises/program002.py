# program002 : factorial
# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:
# 40320

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question,
# it should be assumed to be a console input.

    ans = 1
    for iter in range(1, num + 1):
        ans = ans * iter
    return ans

    print 'Factorial of ', num, ' is : ', factorial(num)
    # print 'Factorial of 5 is : ', factorial(5)
