# Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000
# (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma - separated sequence
# on a single line.

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.
