# program069:
# Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be
# divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is
# input by console.

# Example:
# If the following n is given as input to the program:
# 100
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# 0,35,70

# Hints:
# Use yield to produce the next value in generator.
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.
