# Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list.
# The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

# Then, the output should be:
# 1,3,5,7,9

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question,
# it should be assumed to be a console input.
