# program068:
# Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between
# 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

# Example:
# If the following n is given as input to the program:
# 10
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# 0,2,4,6,8,10

# Hints:
# Use yield to produce the next value in generator.

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.
