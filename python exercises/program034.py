# Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers
# between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.

# Hints:
# Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.

    dictonary = dict()

    for value in range(1, 21):
        dictonary[value] = value ** 2
    print dictonary

    main()
