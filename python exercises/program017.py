# program# : Name
# =>
# Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account
# based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log
# format is shown as following:
# D 100
# W 200
# ��
# D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# D 300
# D 300
# W 200
# D 100
# Then, the output should be:
# 500

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.
