# program065:
# Write a program to compute:

# f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
# and f(0)=0

# with a given n input by console (n>0).

# Example:
# If the following n is given as input to the program:
# 5
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# 500

# In case of input data being supplied to the question,# it should be
# assumed to be a console input.

# Hints:
# We can define recursive function in Python.

# import timeit
