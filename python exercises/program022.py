# Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input.
# The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or
# Python 3.

# Then, the output should be:
# 2:2
# 3.:1
# 3?:1
# New:1
# Python:5
# Read:1
# and:1
# between:1
# choosing:1
# or:2
# to:1

# Hints
# In case of input data being supplied to the question,
# it should be assumed to be a console input.
