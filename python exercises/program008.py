# Write a program that accepts a comma separated
# sequence of words as input and prints the words
# in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# without,hello,bag,world

# Then, the output should be:
# bag,hello,without,world

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.

    li1 = str.split(',')
    # print li1
