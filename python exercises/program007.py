# program007 :
# Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates
# a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and
# j-th column of the array should be i*j.

# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Y-1.

# Example
# Suppose the following inputs are given to the

# program:
# 3,5

# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

# Hints:
# Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question,
# it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.
