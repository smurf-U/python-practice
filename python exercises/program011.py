# program# : Name
# =>
# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated
# 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether
# they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible
# by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
# Example:
# a='0100,0011,1010,1001'
# Then the output should be:
# 1010
# Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question,
# it should be assumed to be a console input.
